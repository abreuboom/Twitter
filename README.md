## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Implementing a photo-view was a particular challenge as I had trouble parsing the data that the network request gave me. I overcame this challenge
Overall, wrapping my head around network requests was a challenge. This was alleviated by my mentors and peers
